## Features
GoshXtruder follows design guidelines with the goal of easy making and assembly of the extruder that is compatible with standard 3D printing parts. It also takes into the account possible variations in size of stock parts and makes adjustments easy.

 - Sherpa Micro compatible mounting holes
 - BMG Reverse Drive Gear compatible
 - Good structural rigidity
 - Low center of mass of the motor
 - Lightweight
 - 3D Printing without supports

Some design elements are implemented to achieve simplicity of making parts and additional rigidity:
 - Thick idler arm
 - Optimized filament guides and path
 - Optional more rigid version of the back element

Recommended materials for 3D printed parts are ABS or ASA. PCABS may work even better.
